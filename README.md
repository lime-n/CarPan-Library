# CarPan-Library

This library will contain scripts belonging to the entire CarPan python library. 
The purpose of this library is initially for me to develop logical syntax so that I can programme without searching things up all the time.
I will try to develop unique syntactical methods of structure descriptive related logic with multiprocessing, concurrency, numpy arrays and pandas.

Update:
- In Progress.

Aims:
1. Develop a multidimensional matrix for any given multiple. Design this so it's static at ```math
SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
```
