# CarPan-Library

This library will contain scripts belonging to the entire CarPan python library. 
The purpose of this library is initially for me to develop logical syntax so that I can programme without searching things up all the time.
I will try to develop unique syntactical methods of structure descriptive related logic with multiprocessing, concurrency, numpy arrays and pandas.

Update:
- In Progress.

Aims:
1. Develop a multidimensional matrix for any given multiple. Design this so it's static at `2` columns with n >= 1 rows.
2. Develop log(2) of the matrix with increasing multiprocessing effects and threading to improve efficiency. 
3. Design convergence criterion for the matrix at 2^n and 2n, designed to prove L-factual spaces and L-determinate spaces. With a finite number of predicates at k = 1/2^n, with w = 2^n.

Future Developments:
1. Defining an attribute space of n-dimensions on a uniform distribution.
2. Defining 1/(2n) random numbers generated from a uniform distribution mapped into the standard normal distribution. The purpose is to arrange matrices at 2 static columns to produce a box-muller generator.
